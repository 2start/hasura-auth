Use SQL instead of GraphQL to interact with the DB

Run DB operations through SQL rather than GraphQL, so the user can pick any [Hasura naming convention configuration](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/schema/postgres/naming-convention/) they want.

As the SQL operations are simpler than the ones generated by Hasura, and as we don't use Hasura anymore to proxy DB operations, it also comes with a slight performance increase.

Hasura-auth now only uses the GraphQL API to generate custom claims.
